ADAO, a module for Data Assimilation and Optimization
================================================================================

About
=====

The ADAO module provides data assimilation and optimization features in SALOME
context or alone. Briefly stated, Data Assimilation is a methodological
framework to compute the optimal estimate of the inaccessible true value of a
system state over time. It uses information coming from experimental
measurements or observations, and from numerical *a priori* models, including
information about their errors. Parts of the framework are also known under the
names of *parameter estimation*, *inverse problems*, *Bayesian estimation*,
*optimal interpolation*, etc.
