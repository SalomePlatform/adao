Calculation algorithm "*NonLinearLeastSquares*"
-----------------------------------------------

.. ------------------------------------ ..
.. include:: snippets/Header2Algo01.rst

This algorithm realizes a state estimation by variational minimization of the
classical :math:`J` function of weighted "Least Squares":

.. math:: J(\mathbf{x})=(\mathbf{y}^o-\mathbf{H}.\mathbf{x})^T.\mathbf{R}^{-1}.(\mathbf{y}^o-\mathbf{H}.\mathbf{x})

It is similar to the :ref:`section_ref_algorithm_3DVAR`, without its background
part. The background, required in the interface, is only used as an initial
point for the variational minimization.

In all cases, it is recommended to prefer the :ref:`section_ref_algorithm_3DVAR`
for its stability as for its behavior during optimization.

StoreSupplementaryCalculations
  .. index:: single: StoreSupplementaryCalculations

  *List of names*. This list indicates the names of the supplementary variables
  that can be available during or at the end of the algorithm, if they are
  initially required by the user. It involves potentially costly calculations
  or memory consumptions. The default is a void list, none of these variables
  being calculated and stored by default excepted the unconditionnal variables.
  The possible names are in the following list: [
  "Analysis",
  "BMA",
  "CostFunctionJ",
  "CostFunctionJAtCurrentOptimum",
  "CostFunctionJb",
  "CostFunctionJbAtCurrentOptimum",
  "CostFunctionJo",
  "CostFunctionJoAtCurrentOptimum",
  "CurrentIterationNumber",
  "CurrentOptimum",
  "CurrentState",
  "IndexOfOptimum",
  "Innovation",
  "InnovationAtCurrentState",
  "OMA",
  "OMB",
  "SimulatedObservationAtBackground",
  "SimulatedObservationAtCurrentOptimum",
  "SimulatedObservationAtCurrentState",
  "SimulatedObservationAtOptimum",
  ].

  Example :
  ``{"StoreSupplementaryCalculations":["BMA", "CurrentState"]}``

*Tips for this algorithm:*

    As the *"BackgroundError"* command is required for ALL the calculation
    algorithms in the graphical interface ADAO EFICAS, you have to provide a
    value, even if this command is not required for this algorithm, and will
    not be used. The simplest way is to give "1" as a STRING.
