Calculation algorithm "*KalmanFilter*"
--------------------------------------

.. ------------------------------------ ..
.. include:: snippets/Header2Algo01.rst

This algorithm realizes an estimation of the state of a dynamic system by a
Kalman Filter.

It is theoretically reserved for observation and incremental evolution operators
cases which are linear, even if it sometimes works in "slightly" non-linear
cases. One can verify the linearity of the operators with the help of
the :ref:`section_ref_algorithm_LinearityTest`.

In case of non-linearity, even slightly marked, it will be preferred the
:ref:`section_ref_algorithm_ExtendedKalmanFilter`, or the
:ref:`section_ref_algorithm_UnscentedKalmanFilter` and the
:ref:`section_ref_algorithm_UnscentedKalmanFilter` that are more powerful.

StoreSupplementaryCalculations
  .. index:: single: StoreSupplementaryCalculations

  This list indicates the names of the supplementary variables that can be
  available at the end of the algorithm. It involves potentially costly
  calculations or memory consumptions. The default is a void list, none of
  these variables being calculated and stored by default. The possible names
  are in the following list: [
  "APosterioriCorrelations",
  "APosterioriCovariance",
  "APosterioriStandardDeviations",
  "APosterioriVariances",
  "BMA",
  "CostFunctionJ",
  "CostFunctionJb",
  "CostFunctionJo",
  "CurrentState",
  "Innovation",
  ].

  Example : ``{"StoreSupplementaryCalculations":["BMA", "Innovation"]}``
