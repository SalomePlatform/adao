Calculation algorithm "*KalmanFilter*"
--------------------------------------

Description
+++++++++++

This algorithm realizes an estimation of the state of a dynamic system by a
Kalman Filter.

It is theoretically reserved for observation and incremental evolution operators
cases which are linear, even if it sometimes works in "slightly" non-linear
cases. One can verify the linearity of the operators with the help of
the :ref:`section_ref_algorithm_LinearityTest`.

In case of non-linearity, even slightly marked, it will be preferred the
:ref:`section_ref_algorithm_ExtendedKalmanFilter`, or the
:ref:`section_ref_algorithm_UnscentedKalmanFilter` and the
:ref:`section_ref_algorithm_UnscentedKalmanFilter` that are more powerful.

Optional and required commands
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The general required commands, available in the editing user interface, are the
following:

  .. include:: snippets/Background.rst

  .. include:: snippets/BackgroundError.rst

  .. include:: snippets/EvolutionError.rst

  .. include:: snippets/EvolutionModel.rst

  .. include:: snippets/Observation.rst

  .. include:: snippets/ObservationError.rst

  .. include:: snippets/ObservationOperator.rst

The general optional commands, available in the editing user interface, are
indicated in :ref:`section_ref_assimilation_keywords`. Moreover, the parameters
of the command "*AlgorithmParameters*" allows to choose the specific options,
described hereafter, of the algorithm. See
:ref:`section_ref_options_Algorithm_Parameters` for the good use of this
command.

The options of the algorithm are the following:

  .. include:: snippets/EstimationOf.rst

  StoreSupplementaryCalculations
    .. index:: single: StoreSupplementaryCalculations

    This list indicates the names of the supplementary variables that can be
    available at the end of the algorithm. It involves potentially costly
    calculations or memory consumptions. The default is a void list, none of
    these variables being calculated and stored by default. The possible names
    are in the following list: ["APosterioriCorrelations",
    "APosterioriCovariance", "APosterioriStandardDeviations",
    "APosterioriVariances", "BMA", "CostFunctionJ", "CostFunctionJb",
    "CostFunctionJo", "CurrentState", "Innovation"].

    Example : ``{"StoreSupplementaryCalculations":["BMA", "Innovation"]}``

Information and variables available at the end of the algorithm
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

At the output, after executing the algorithm, there are variables and
information originating from the calculation. The description of
:ref:`section_ref_output_variables` show the way to obtain them by the method
named ``get`` of the variable "*ADD*" of the post-processing. The input
variables, available to the user at the output in order to facilitate the
writing of post-processing procedures, are described in the
:ref:`subsection_r_o_v_Inventaire`.

The unconditional outputs of the algorithm are the following:

  .. include:: snippets/Analysis.rst

The conditional outputs of the algorithm are the following:

  .. include:: snippets/APosterioriCorrelations.rst

  .. include:: snippets/APosterioriCovariance.rst

  .. include:: snippets/APosterioriStandardDeviations.rst

  .. include:: snippets/APosterioriVariances.rst

  .. include:: snippets/BMA.rst

  .. include:: snippets/CostFunctionJ.rst

  .. include:: snippets/CostFunctionJb.rst

  .. include:: snippets/CostFunctionJo.rst

  .. include:: snippets/CurrentState.rst

  .. include:: snippets/Innovation.rst
