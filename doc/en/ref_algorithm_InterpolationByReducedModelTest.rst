Checking algorithm "*InterpolationByReducedModelTest*"
------------------------------------------------------

.. include:: snippets/Header2Algo01.rst

This algorithm provides a simple way of analyzing the quality of the empirical
interpolation obtained by a reduced basis for complete states, using
measurements at precise points.

The results displayed by default are simple statistics related to the
normalized errors between the interpolation with a reduced basis and the
complete states we seek to represent on the reduced basis. The test requires a
reduced basis and a set of optimal measurement positions, and uses
pseudo-measurements from each complete state ("*snapshot*") included in the
given test set.

Please note: to be consistent, this test must use the same mathematical norm as
that used to construct the reduced basis. As the norm is chosen by the user
when defining the test, the norm used to construct the reduced basis must be
verified.
