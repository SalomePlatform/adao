Requirements for describing a state sampling
--------------------------------------------

.. index:: single: SamplingTest
.. index:: single: State sampling
.. index:: single: Sampling

In general, it is useful to have a sampling of states when you are interested
in analyses that benefit from knowledge of a set of simulations or a set of
similar measurements, but each obtained for a different state.

This is the case for the explicit definition of simulatable states of
:ref:`section_ref_algorithm_SamplingTest`,
:ref:`section_ref_algorithm_EnsembleOfSimulationGenerationTask` and
:ref:`section_ref_algorithm_MeasurementsOptimalPositioningTask`.

All these states can be described explicitly or implicitly, to simplify their
listing. Possible descriptions are given below, followed by very simple
examples to show the types of state distribution obtained in the space.

Explicit or implicit description of the state sampling collection
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The state sampling collection can be described using dedicated keywords in the
command set of an algorithm that requires it.

The sampling of the states :math:`\mathbf{x}` can be provided explicitly or in
the form of hypercubes, explicit or sampled according to common distributions,
or using Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) or Sobol sequences. Depending on the
method, the sample will be included in the domain described by its bounds, or
will be descriptive of the unbounded domain of state variables.

These possible keywords are:

.. include:: snippets/SampleAsExplicitHyperCube.rst

.. include:: snippets/SampleAsIndependantRandomVariables.rst

.. include:: snippets/SampleAsMinMaxLatinHyperCube.rst

.. include:: snippets/SampleAsMinMaxSobolSequence.rst

.. include:: snippets/SampleAsMinMaxStepHyperCube.rst

.. include:: snippets/SampleAsnUplet.rst

Beware of the size of the hypercube (and then to the number of computations)
that can be reached, it can grow quickly to be quite large.

Simple examples of state-space distributions
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To illustrate the commands, we propose here simple state distributions obtained
in a 2-dimensional state space (to be representable), and the commands that
enable them to be obtained. We arbitrarily choose to place 25 states in each
case. In most of the commands, since the states are described separately
according to each coordinate, 5 coordinate values are requested per axis.

The first three keywords illustrate the same distribution, as they are simply
different ways of describing it.

Explicit state distribution by keyword "*SampleAsnUplet*"
.........................................................

Explicit sample generation command by "*SampleAsnUplet*" is as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    [...]
    "SampleAsnUplet":[[0, 0], [0, 1], [0, 2], [0, 3], [0, 4],
                      [1, 0], [1, 1], [1, 2], [1, 3], [1, 4],
                      [2, 0], [2, 1], [2, 2], [2, 3], [2, 4],
                      [3, 0], [3, 1], [3, 2], [3, 3], [3, 4],
