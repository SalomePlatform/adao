Calculation algorithm "*4DVAR*"
-------------------------------

.. ------------------------------------ ..
.. include:: snippets/Header2Algo01.rst

This algorithm realizes an estimation of the state of a dynamic system, by a
variational minimization method of the classical :math:`J` function in data
assimilation:

.. math:: J(\mathbf{x})=(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}^b)^T.\mathbf{B}^{-1}.(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}^b)+\sum_{t\in T}(\mathbf{y^o}(t)-H(\mathbf{x},t))^T.\mathbf{R}^{-1}.(\mathbf{y^o}(t)-H(\mathbf{x},t))

which is usually designed as the "*4D-Var*" functional (see for example
[Talagrand97]_). The terms "*4D-Var*", "*4D-VAR*" and "*4DVAR*" are equivalent.
It is well suited in cases of non-linear observation and evolution operators,
its application domain is similar to the one of Kalman filters, specially the
:ref:`section_ref_algorithm_ExtendedKalmanFilter` or the
:ref:`section_ref_algorithm_UnscentedKalmanFilter`.

  *List of names*. This list indicates the names of the supplementary
  variables, that can be available during or at the end of the algorithm, if
  they are initially required by the user. Their avalability involves,
  potentially, costly calculations or memory consumptions. The default is then
  a void list, none of these variables being calculated and stored by default
  (excepted the unconditionnal variables). The possible names are in the
  following list (the detailed description of each named variable is given in
  the following part of this specific algorithmic documentation, in the
  sub-section "*Information and variables available at the end of the
  algorithm*"): [
  "Analysis",
  "BMA",
  "CostFunctionJ",
  "CostFunctionJAtCurrentOptimum",
  "CostFunctionJb",
  "CostFunctionJbAtCurrentOptimum",
  "CostFunctionJo",
  "CostFunctionJoAtCurrentOptimum",
  "CurrentIterationNumber",
  "CurrentOptimum",
  "CurrentState",
  "IndexOfOptimum",
  ].
