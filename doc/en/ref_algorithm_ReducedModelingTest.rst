Checking algorithm "*ReducedModelingTest*"
------------------------------------------

.. ------------------------------------ ..
.. include:: snippets/Header2Algo00.rst

.. ------------------------------------ ..
.. include:: snippets/Header2Algo01.rst

This checking algorithm provides a simple analysis of the characteristics of
the state collection from the point of view of reduction. It aims to diagnose
the complexity of the information present in the available state collection,
and the possibility to represent this state information in a space smaller than
the entire state collection. Technically, based on a classical SVD (Singular
Value Decomposition) and in the same way as a PCA (Principal Component
Analysis), it evaluates how information decreases with the number of singular
values, either as values or, from a statistical point of view, as remaining
variance.

Once the analysis is complete, a summary is displayed and, on request, a
graphical representation of the same information is produced.

StoreSupplementaryCalculations
  .. index:: single: StoreSupplementaryCalculations

  *List of names*. This list indicates the names of the supplementary
  variables, that can be available during or at the end of the algorithm, if
  they are initially required by the user. Their availability involves,
  potentially, costly calculations or memory consumptions. The default is then
  a void list, none of these variables being calculated and stored by default
  (excepted the unconditional variables). The possible names are in the
  following list (the detailed description of each named variable is given in
  the following part of this specific algorithmic documentation, in the
  sub-section "*Information and variables available at the end of the
  algorithm*"): [
  "EnsembleOfSimulations",
  "EnsembleOfStates",
  "Residus",
  "SingularValues",
  ].

  Example :
  ``{"StoreSupplementaryCalculations":["CurrentState", "Residu"]}``
