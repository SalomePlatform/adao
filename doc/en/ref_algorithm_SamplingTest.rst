Checking algorithm "*SamplingTest*"
-----------------------------------

.. ------------------------------------ ..
.. include:: snippets/Header2Algo01.rst

This test algorithm is used to establish the collection of values of an error
functional :math:`J` of type :math:`L^1`, :math:`L^2` or :math:`L^{\infty}`,
with or without weights, using the observation operator :math:`\mathcal{H}`,
for an a priori given sample of states :math:`\mathbf{x}`. The default error
functional is the augmented weighted least squares functional, classically used
in data assimilation, using in addition to observations :math:`\mathbf{y}^o`.

This test is useful for analyzing the sensitivity of the functional :math:`J`
to variations in the state :math:`\mathbf{x}` in particular.

The sampling of the states :math:`\mathbf{x}` can be given explicitly or under
form of hypercubes, explicit or sampled according to classic distributions, or
using Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) or Sobol sequences. The computations are
optimized according to the computer resources available and the options
requested by the user. You can refer to the
:ref:`section_ref_sampling_requirements` for an illustration of sampling.
Beware of the size of the hypercube (and then to the number of computations)
that can be reached, it can grow quickly to be quite large. When a state is not
observable, a *"NaN"* value is returned.

It is also possible to supply a set of simulations :math:`\mathbf{y}` already
established elsewhere (so there's no explicit need for an operator
:math:`\mathcal{H}`), which are implicitly associated with a set of state
samples :math:`\mathbf{x}`. In this case where the set of simulations is
provided, it is imperative to also provide the set of states :math:`\mathbf{x}`
by explicit sampling, whose state order corresponds to the order of the
simulations :math:`\mathbf{y}`.

To access the calculated information, the results of the sampling or
simulations must be requested **explicitly** to avoid storage difficulties (if
no results are requested, nothing is available). One use for that, on the
desired variable, the final saving through "*UserPostAnalysis*" or the
treatment during the calculation by well suited "*observer*".

StoreSupplementaryCalculations
  .. index:: single: StoreSupplementaryCalculations

  *List of names*. This list indicates the names of the supplementary
  variables, that can be available during or at the end of the algorithm, if
  they are initially required by the user. Their availability involves,
  potentially, costly calculations or memory consumptions. The default is then
  a void list, none of these variables being calculated and stored by default
  (excepted the unconditional variables). The possible names are in the
  following list (the detailed description of each named variable is given in
  the following part of this specific algorithmic documentation, in the
  sub-section "*Information and variables available at the end of the
  algorithm*"): [
  "CostFunctionJ",
  "CostFunctionJb",
  "CostFunctionJo",
  "CurrentState",
  "EnsembleOfSimulations",
  "EnsembleOfStates",
  "Innovation",
  "InnovationAtCurrentState",
  "SimulatedObservationAtCurrentState",
  ].

  Example :
  ``{"StoreSupplementaryCalculations":["CurrentState", "Residu"]}``
