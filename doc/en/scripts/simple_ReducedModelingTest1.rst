First example
.............

This example describes the reducibility characteristics of the set of states
(“*snapshots*”) under study. The set considered is first composed of 15 sine
calculations on a sequence of integers (so the space generated by the snapshots
is linearly non-decomposable) and these 15 snapshots are then duplicated once
to obtain a reduced space of size exactly 15 (since the last 15 are identical
to the first 15). All the variance is thus explained by the first 15 modes,
numbered from 0 to 14, and the following singular values are close to numerical
zero.
