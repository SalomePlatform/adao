.. index:: single: MeasurementsOptimalPositioningTask (example)

Second example
..............

This example describes the same optimal positioning of measurements, followed
by an analysis of the **reduced representation and errors** obtained during the
search for optimal positions.

The initial part of the script is identical to the previous one, with the same
artificial collection of physical fields and the same analysis by ADAO. We then
add the recovery of the reduced base and a very simple example of decomposition
on the reduced base, exact in this simple case, of one of the physical fields
initially provided.
