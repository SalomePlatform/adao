In the figure, the lines simply join the simulated values at the control points
and make them easier to read.

We see, in this particularly simple case, that the optimum is identical to the
values of coefficients ``[2, -1, 2]`` used to generate the pseudo-observations
for the twin experiment. Naturally, the final simulation obtained with the
adjusted coefficients coincides with the observations at the 5 control points.

To illustrate more clearly the recalibration performed, using the same
information, we can plot the "continuous" version of the quadratic curves
available for the background state of the coefficients, and for the optimal
state of the coefficients, together with the values obtained at the control
points. In addition, to improve readability, the lines joining the simulations
in the previous graph have been removed.
