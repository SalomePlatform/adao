.. index:: single: KalmanFilter (example)

The Kalman Filter can be used for a **reanalysis of observations of a given
dynamical model**. It is because the whole set of the observation  full history
is already known at the beginning of the time windows that it is called
*reanalysis*, even if the iterative analysis keeps unkown the future
observations at a given time step.
