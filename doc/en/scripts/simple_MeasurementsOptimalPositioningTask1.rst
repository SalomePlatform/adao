.. index:: single: MeasurementsOptimalPositioningTask (exemple)

First example
.............

This example describes the implementation of a search for **optimal measurement
positioning**. To illustrate, we construct a very simple artificial collection
of physical fields (generated here so as to exist in a vector space of
dimension 2). The default ADAO search then easily yields 2 optimal positions
for the measurements, as illustrated by the display at the end of the script.
