.. index:: single: Derivation potentially required or not

- The methods proposed by this algorithm **may require the derivation of the
  objective function or of one of the operators**. In the case where a
  derivation is required, it needs that at least one or both of the observation
  or evolution operators are differentiable, and this implies an additional
  calculation time in the case where the derivatives are calculated numerically
  by multiple evaluations.
