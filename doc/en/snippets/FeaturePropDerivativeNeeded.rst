.. index:: single: Derivation required

- The methods proposed by this algorithm **require the derivation of the
  objective function or of one of the operators**. It requires that at least
  one or both of the observation or evolution operators be differentiable, and
  this implies an additional cost in the case where the derivatives are
  calculated numerically by multiple evaluations.
