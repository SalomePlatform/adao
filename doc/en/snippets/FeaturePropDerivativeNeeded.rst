.. index:: single: Derivation required

- The methods proposed by this algorithm **require the derivation of the
  objective function or of one of the operators**. It requires that at least
  one or both of the observation or evolution operators are differentiable, and
  this implies an additional calculation time in the case where the derivatives
  are calculated numerically by multiple evaluations.
