.. index:: single: Parallelism of derivation

- The methods proposed by this algorithm **have no internal parallelism, but
  use the numerical derivation of operator(s), which can be parallelized**. The
  potential interaction, between the parallelism of the numerical derivation,
  and the parallelism that may be present in the observation or evolution
  operators embedding user codes, must therefore be carefully tuned.
