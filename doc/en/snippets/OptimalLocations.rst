.. index:: single: OptimalLocations

OptimalLocations
  *List of integer series*. Each element is a series, containing the indices of
  ideal positions or optimal points where a measurement is required, in the
  order of the variables of a state vector considered arbitrarily in
  one-dimensional form, and in the same order as the vectors of the reduced
  basis found iteratively.

  It is identical to a single output of the ideal positions or optimum points
  of a :ref:`section_ref_algorithm_MeasurementsOptimalPositioningTask`.
