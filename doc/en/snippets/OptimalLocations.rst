.. index:: single: OptimalLocations

OptimalLocations
  *Integer series*. This series contains the indices of ideal positions or
  optimal points where a measurement is required, in the order of the variables
  of a state vector considered arbitrarily in one-dimensional form, and in the
  same order as the vectors of the reduced basis found iteratively.

  It is identical to a single output (one single series) of the ideal positions
  or optimum points (which is a list of integer series) of a
  :ref:`section_ref_algorithm_MeasurementsOptimalPositioningTask`.
