.. index:: single: ObservationsAlreadyRestrictedOnOptimalLocations

ObservationsAlreadyRestrictedOnOptimalLocations
  *Boolean value*. The variable defines whether measurements are supplied only
  at the ideal positions or optimum points at which a measurement is required
  ("True", default value), or whether they are supplied on a medium identical
  to the complete field and must therefore be restricted to the required
  positions ("False").

  Example :
  ``{"ObservationsAlreadyRestrictedOnOptimalLocations":False}``
