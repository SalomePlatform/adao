.. index:: single: Observers

Observers
  *List of functions linked to variables*. This command allows to set internal
  observers, that are functions linked with a particular variable, which will
  be executed each time this variable is modified. It is a convenient way to
  monitor variables of interest during the data assimilation or optimization
  process, by printing or plotting it, etc. Common templates are provided to
  help the user to start or to quickly make his case.
