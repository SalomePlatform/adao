.. index:: single: AmplitudeOfInitialDirection

AmplitudeOfInitialDirection
  This key indicates the scaling of the initial perturbation build as a vector
  used for the directional derivative around the nominal checking point. The
  default is 1, that means no scaling.

  Example:
  ``{"AmplitudeOfInitialDirection":0.5}``
