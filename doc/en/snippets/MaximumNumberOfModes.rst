.. index:: single: MaximumNumberOfModes

MaximumNumberOfModes
  *Integer value*. This key indicates the maximum possible number of
  decomposition modes to be included in the reduction analysis. The default
  value is 1.e6, which is very similar to no limit on this number of modes, and
  it is recommended to adapt it to the needs of real problems.

  Example :
  ``{"MaximumNumberOfModes":5}``
