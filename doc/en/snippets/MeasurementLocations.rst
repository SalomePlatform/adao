.. index:: single: MeasurementLocations

MeasurementLocations
  *Integer series*. This series contains the indices of the positions at which
  a measurement is required to support a reduced basis interpolation, according
  to the order of the variables of a state vector arbitrarily considered in
  one-dimensional form, and in the same order as the information contained in
  the vectors of the reduced basis.

  This is similar to the set of optimal positions or points resulting from a
  :ref:`section_ref_algorithm_MeasurementsOptimalPositioningTask`, or the set
  of positions required to run a
  :ref:`section_ref_algorithm_InterpolationByReducedModelTask`.
