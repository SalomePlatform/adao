.. index:: single: MaximumNumberOfIterations

MaximumNumberOfIterations
  *Integer value*. This key indicates the maximum number of internal iterations
  allowed for iterative optimization. The default is 50, which is an arbitrary
  limit. It is then recommended to adapt this parameter to the needs on real
  problems.

  Example:
  ``{"MaximumNumberOfIterations":50}``
