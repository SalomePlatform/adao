.. index:: single: ReducedBasisMus

ReducedBasisMus
  *List of integer series*. Each element is a series, containing the indices of
  the :math:`\mu` parameters characterizing a state, in the order chosen during
  the iterative search process for vectors of the reduced basis.

  Example :
  ``op = ADD.get("ReducedBasisMus")[-1]``
