.. index:: single: StoreInitialState

StoreInitialState
  *Boolean value*. This variable defines whether the algorithm's initial state
  is stored (with True) or not (with False, by default) as the first state in
  the iterative sequence of found states. This makes algorithmic iterative
  storage identical to temporal iterative storage (similar, for example, to
  Kalman filters).

  Example :
  ``{"StoreInitialState":False}``
