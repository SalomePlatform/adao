Each version of the ADAO module is validated within the framework of SALOME,
and is therefore compatible with the environment implicitly defined by the
corresponding |release| version of SALOME identical to that of ADAO for the
current document. The validation versions are indicated here for information
purposes only, knowing that, in case of doubt, the SALOME version sheet
[Salome]_ is the official validation version.
