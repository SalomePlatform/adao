.. index:: single: No algorithmic parallelism

- The methods proposed by this algorithm **have no internal parallelism or
  numerical derivation of operator(s)**, and therefore cannot take advantage of
  computer resources for distributing calculations. The methods are sequential,
  and any use of parallelism resources is therefore reserved for observation or
  evolution operators, i.e. user codes.
