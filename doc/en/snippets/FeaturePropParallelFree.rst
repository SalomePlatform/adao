.. index:: single: Absence of algorithmic parallelism

- The methods proposed by this algorithm **have no internal parallelism**, and
  therefore cannot take advantage of computer resources for distributing
  calculations. The methods are sequential, and any use of parallelism
  resources is therefore reserved for the user's observation or evolution
  operators.
