AlgorithmParameters
  *Dictionary*. This variable indicates the data assimilation or optimization
  algorithm chosen by the keyword "*Algorithm*", and its potential optional
  parameters. The potential choices by this keyword "*Algorithm*" are available
  through the graphical interface or in the reference documentation containing
  a specific sub-section for each of them. There are for example the "3DVAR",
  the "Blue", etc. Optionally, the command also allows to add parameters to
  control the chosen algorithm. Their values are defined either explicitly or
  in a "*Dict*" type object. See the
  :ref:`section_ref_options_Algorithm_Parameters` for the detailed use of this
  command part.
