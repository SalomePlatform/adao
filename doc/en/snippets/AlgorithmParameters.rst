AlgorithmParameters
  *Dictionary*. This variable indicates the data assimilation or optimization
  algorithm chosen by the keyword "*Algorithm*", and its potential optional
  parameters. The algorithm choices are available through the GUI. There exists
  for example "3DVAR", "Blue"... Each algorithm is defined, below, by a
  specific subsection. Optionally, the command allows also to add some
  parameters to control the algorithm. Their values are defined either
  explicitly or in a "*Dict*" type object. See the
  :ref:`section_ref_options_Algorithm_Parameters` for the detailed use of this
  command part.
