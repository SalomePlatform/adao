NoiseDistribution
  *Predefined name*. This key indicates the type of the distribution used to
  generate the state perturbations. This distribution can be of "Uniform" or
  "Gaussian" type. The default is a distribution of "Uniform" type, and it is
  recommended to adapt it to the needs on real problems.

  Example :
  ``{"NoiseDistribution":"Uniform"}``
