SampleAsMinMaxStepHyperCube
  *List of triplets of real values*. This key describes the calculations points
  as an hyper-cube, from a given list of implicit sampling of each variable by
  a triplet *[min,max,step]*. That is then a list of the same size than the one
  of the state. The bounds are included. By nature, the points are included in
  the domain defined by the explicit bounds.

  Example :
  ``{"SampleAsMinMaxStepHyperCube":[[0.,1.,0.25],[-1,3,1]]}`` for a state space of dimension 2.
