Information and variables available at the end of the algorithm
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

At the output, after executing the algorithm, there are information and
variables originating from the calculation. The description of
:ref:`section_ref_output_variables` show the way to obtain them by the method
named ``get``, of the variable "*ADD*" of the post-processing in graphical
interface, or of the case in textual interface. The input variables, available
to the user at the output in order to facilitate the writing of post-processing
procedures, are described in the :ref:`subsection_r_o_v_Inventaire`.

**Permanent outputs (non conditional)**

The unconditional outputs of the algorithm are the following:
