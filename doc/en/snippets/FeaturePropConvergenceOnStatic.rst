.. index:: single: Convergence on static criteria

- The methods proposed by this algorithm **achieve their convergence on one or
  more static criteria, fixed by some particular algorithmic properties**. In
  practice, there may be several convergence criteria active simultaneously.

  The more frequent algorithmic property is the one of direct calculations,
  which evaluate the converged solution without any controllable iteration.
  There is no convergence threshold to be adjusted in this case.
