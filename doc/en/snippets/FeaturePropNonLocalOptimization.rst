.. index:: single: Non local optimization

- The optimization methods proposed by this algorithm perform a **non-local
  search for the minimum**, without however ensuring a global search. This is
  the case when optimization methods have the ability to avoid being trapped by
  the first local minimum found. These capabilities are sometimes heuristic.
