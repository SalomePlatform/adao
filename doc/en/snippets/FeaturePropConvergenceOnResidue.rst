.. index:: single: Convergence on residue criteria

- The methods proposed by this algorithm **achieve their convergence on one or
  more residue criteria**. In practice, there may be several convergence
  criteria active simultaneously.

  The residue can be a conventional measure based on a gap (e.g.
  "*calculation-measurement gap*"), or be a significant value for the algorithm
  (e.g. "*nullity of gradient*").

  Convergence thresholds need to be carefully adjusted, to reduce the gobal
  calculation cost, or to ensure that convergence is adapted to the physical
  case encountered.
