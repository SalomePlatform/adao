HybridCovarianceEquilibrium
  *Real value*. This key indicates, in hybrid variational optimization, the
  equilibrium factor between the static *a priori* covariance and the ensemble
  covariance. This factor is between 0 and 1, and its default value is 0.5.

  Example :
  ``{"HybridCovarianceEquilibrium":0.5}``
