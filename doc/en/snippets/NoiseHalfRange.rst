.. index:: single: NoiseHalfRange

NoiseHalfRange
  This key indicates,, only in the case of a "Uniform" distribution type asked
  through the keyword "*NoiseDistribution*", the half-amplitude of the uniform
  state centred perturbations for each component of the state. The default is
  an empty list, this key must therefore be filled in in the case of a
  "Uniform" distribution. A simple way to do this is to give a list of the
  length of the desired state with identical half-amplitudes, as in the example
  below with half-amplitudes of 3%. It is recommended to take half-amplitudes
  of a few percent maximum.

  Example :
  ``{"NoiseHalfRange":<longueur de l'Ã©tat>*[0.03]}``
