.. index:: single: MaximumNumberOfSteps

MaximumNumberOfSteps
  This key indicates the maximum number of iterations allowed for iterative
  optimization. The default is 50, which is an arbitrary limit. It is then
  recommended to adapt this parameter to the needs on real problems.

  Example:
  ``{"MaximumNumberOfSteps":50}``
