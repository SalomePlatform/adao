.. index:: single: EnsembleOfStates

EnsembleOfStates
  *List of vectors or matrix*. Each element is an ordered collection of
  physical or parameter state vectors :math:`\mathbf{x}`, with 1 state per
  column if it is a matrix, or 1 state per element if it is a list. Caution:
  the numbering of the support or points, on which or to which a state value is
  given in each vector, is implicitly that of the natural order of numbering of
  the state vector, from 0 to the "size minus 1" of this vector.

  Example :
  ``{"EnsembleOfStates":[x1, x2, x3...]}``
