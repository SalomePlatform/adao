NumberOfElementaryPerturbations
  *Integer value*. This key indicates the number of elementary perturbations
  that will be performed to select a complete state perturbation. The default
  is 1, and it is recommended to adapt it carefully to the needs of real
  problems, without choosing too many elementary perturbations.

  Example :
  ``{"NumberOfElementaryPerturbations":1}``
