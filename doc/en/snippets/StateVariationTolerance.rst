.. index:: single: StateVariationTolerance

StateVariationTolerance
  This key indicates the maximum relative variation of the state for stopping
  by convergence on the state.  The default is 1.e-4, and it is recommended to
  adapt it to the needs on real problems.

  Example:
  ``{"StateVariationTolerance":1.e-4}``
