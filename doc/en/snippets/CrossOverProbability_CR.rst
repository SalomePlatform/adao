.. index:: single: CrossOverProbability_CR

CrossOverProbability_CR
  This key is used to define the probability of recombination or crossover
  during the differential evolution. This variable is usually noted as ``CR``
  in the literature. The default value is 0.7, and it is recommended to change
  it if necessary.

  Example:
  ``{"CrossOverProbability_CR":0.7}``
