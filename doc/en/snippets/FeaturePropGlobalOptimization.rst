.. index:: single: Global optimization

- The optimization methods proposed by this algorithm perform a **global search
  for the minimum**, theoretically achieving a globally optimal state over the
  search domain. However, this global optimality is achieved "*at
  convergence*", which means in long or infinite time during an iterative
  optimization "*with real values*" (as opposed to "*with integer values*").
