.. index:: single: Algorithmic parallelism included

- The methods proposed by this algorithm **have internal parallelism**, and can
  therefore take advantage of computational distribution resources. The
  potential interaction, between the parallelism of the numerical derivation,
  and the parallelism that may be present in the observation or evolution
  operators embedding user codes, must therefore be carefully tuned.
