.. index:: single: Algorithmic parallelism included

- The methods proposed by this algorithm **have internal parallelism**, and can
  therefore take advantage of computational distribution resources. The
  potential interaction between the internal parallelism of the methods and the
  parallelism that may be present in the user's observation or evolution
  operators must therefore be carefully tuned.
