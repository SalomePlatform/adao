Calculation algorithm "*EnsembleKalmanFilter*"
----------------------------------------------

.. ------------------------------------ ..
.. include:: snippets/Header2Algo01.rst

This algorithm realizes an estimation of the state of a dynamic system by a
Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF), avoiding to have to perform the tangent and
adjoint operators for the observation and evolution operators, as in the simple
or extended Kalman filter.

It applies to non-linear observation and incremental evolution (process)
operators with excellent robustness and performance qualities. It can be
compared to the :ref:`section_ref_algorithm_UnscentedKalmanFilter`, whose
qualities are similar for non-linear systems.

In case of linear of "slightly" non-linear operators, one can easily use the
:ref:`section_ref_algorithm_ExtendedKalmanFilter` or even the
:ref:`section_ref_algorithm_KalmanFilter`, which are often far less expensive
to evaluate on small systems. One can verify the linearity of the operators
with the help of the :ref:`section_ref_algorithm_LinearityTest`.

StoreSupplementaryCalculations
  .. index:: single: StoreSupplementaryCalculations

  This list indicates the names of the supplementary variables that can be
  available at the end of the algorithm, if they are initially required by the
  user. It involves potentially costly calculations or memory consumptions. The
  default is a void list, none of these variables being calculated and stored
  by default excepted the unconditionnal variables. The possible names are in
  the following list: [
  "Analysis",
  "APosterioriCorrelations",
  "APosterioriCovariance",
  "APosterioriStandardDeviations",
  "APosterioriVariances",
  "BMA",
  "CostFunctionJ",
  "CostFunctionJAtCurrentOptimum",
  "CostFunctionJb",
  "CostFunctionJbAtCurrentOptimum",
  "CostFunctionJo",
  "CostFunctionJoAtCurrentOptimum",
  "CurrentOptimum",
  "CurrentState",
  "IndexOfOptimum",
  "InnovationAtCurrentAnalysis",
  "InnovationAtCurrentState",
  "PredictedState",
  "SimulatedObservationAtCurrentAnalysis",
  "SimulatedObservationAtCurrentOptimum",
  "SimulatedObservationAtCurrentState",
  ].

  Example :
  ``{"StoreSupplementaryCalculations":["BMA", "CurrentState"]}``
