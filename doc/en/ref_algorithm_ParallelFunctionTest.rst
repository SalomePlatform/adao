Checking algorithm "*ParallelFunctionTest*"
-------------------------------------------

.. ------------------------------------ ..
.. include:: snippets/Header2Algo01.rst

This algorithm allows to verify that the observation operator is working
correctly in parallel and that its call is compatible with its usage in ADAO
algorithms. In practice, it allows to call one or several times the operator in
parallel, activating or not the "debug" mode during execution.

Statistics on input and output vectors for each execution of operator are
given, and an another global statistic is given at the end of the checking
algorithm. The precision of printed outputs can be controlled to facilitate
automatic tests of operator. It may also be useful to check the entries
themselves beforehand with the intended test
:ref:`section_ref_algorithm_InputValuesTest`.

  *List of names*. This list indicates the names of the supplementary
  variables, that can be available during or at the end of the algorithm, if
  they are initially required by the user. Their avalability involves,
  potentially, costly calculations or memory consumptions. The default is then
  a void list, none of these variables being calculated and stored by default
  (excepted the unconditionnal variables). The possible names are in the
  following list (the detailed description of each named variable is given in
  the following part of this specific algorithmic documentation, in the
  sub-section "*Information and variables available at the end of the
  algorithm*"): [
  "CurrentState",
  "SimulatedObservationAtCurrentState",
  ].

  Example :
  ``{"StoreSupplementaryCalculations":["BMA", "CurrentState"]}``
