Calculation algorithm "*Blue*"
------------------------------

.. ------------------------------------ ..
.. include:: snippets/Header2Algo01.rst

This algorithm realizes a BLUE (Best Linear Unbiased Estimator) type estimation
of the state of a system. It is a linear, unbiased and optimal estimation.
Technically, it is an Aitken estimator.

This algorithm is always the fastest of all the assimilation algorithms of ADAO.
It is theoretically reserved for observation operator cases which are linear,
even if it sometimes works in "slightly" non-linear cases. One can verify the
linearity of the observation operator with the help of the
:ref:`section_ref_algorithm_LinearityTest`.

In case of non-linearity, even slightly marked, it will be easily preferred the
:ref:`section_ref_algorithm_ExtendedBlue` or the
:ref:`section_ref_algorithm_3DVAR`.

.. index:: single: Optimal Interpolation

Additional remark: an algebraic simplification of the BLUE leads to the optimal
interpolation method, named "*Optimal Interpolation*" or "*OI*". It is a very
simple and inexpensive method, especially adapted to very (very) large
problems, but whose disadvantage is to provide a globally sub-optimal and noisy
analysis result, even inconsistent. The way to avoid these disadvantages is to
adapt very precisely the elements of the method to each physical model. For
these reasons, this method is not proposed nor recommended.

StoreSupplementaryCalculations
  .. index:: single: StoreSupplementaryCalculations

  *List of names*. This list indicates the names of the supplementary variables
  that can be available during or at the end of the algorithm, if they are
  initially required by the user. It involves potentially costly calculations
  or memory consumptions. The default is a void list, none of these variables
  being calculated and stored by default excepted the unconditionnal variables.
  The possible names are in the following list: [
  "Analysis",
  "APosterioriCorrelations",
  "APosterioriCovariance",
  "APosterioriStandardDeviations",
  "APosterioriVariances",
  "BMA",
  "CostFunctionJ",
  "CostFunctionJAtCurrentOptimum",
  "CostFunctionJb",
  "CostFunctionJbAtCurrentOptimum",
  "CostFunctionJo",
  "CostFunctionJoAtCurrentOptimum",
  "CurrentOptimum",
  "CurrentState",
  "Innovation",
  "MahalanobisConsistency",
  "OMA",
  "OMB",
  "SigmaBck2",
  "SigmaObs2",
  "SimulatedObservationAtBackground",
  "SimulatedObservationAtCurrentOptimum",
  "SimulatedObservationAtCurrentState",
  "SimulatedObservationAtOptimum",
  "SimulationQuantiles",
  ].
