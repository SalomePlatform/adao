Calculation algorithm "*Blue*"
------------------------------

Description
+++++++++++

This algorithm realizes a BLUE (Best Linear Unbiased Estimator) type estimation
of the state of a system. More precisely, it is an Aitken estimator.

This algorithm is always the fastest of all the assimilation algorithms of ADAO.
It is theoretically reserved for observation operator cases which are linear,
even if it sometimes works in "slightly" non-linear cases. One can verify the
linearity of the observation operator with the help of the
:ref:`section_ref_algorithm_LinearityTest`.

In case of non-linearity, even slightly marked, it will be easily prefered the
:ref:`section_ref_algorithm_ExtendedBlue` or the
:ref:`section_ref_algorithm_3DVAR`.

Optional and required commands

.. index:: single: StoreSupplementaryCalculations

The general required commands, available in the editing user interface, are the
following:

  Background
    *Required command*. This indicates the background or initial vector used,
    previously noted as :math:`\mathbf{x}^b`. Its value is defined as a
    "*Vector*" or a *VectorSerie*" type object.

  BackgroundError
    *Required command*. This indicates the background error covariance matrix,
    previously noted as :math:`\mathbf{B}`. Its value is defined as a "*Matrix*"
    type object, a "*ScalarSparseMatrix*" type object, or a
    "*DiagonalSparseMatrix*" type object.

  Observation
    *Required command*. This indicates the observation vector used for data
    assimilation or optimization, previously noted as :math:`\mathbf{y}^o`. It
    is defined as a "*Vector*" or a *VectorSerie* type object.

  ObservationError
    *Required command*. This indicates the observation error covariance matrix,
    previously noted as :math:`\mathbf{R}`. It is defined as a "*Matrix*" type
    object, a "*ScalarSparseMatrix*" type object, or a "*DiagonalSparseMatrix*"
    type object.

  ObservationOperator
    *Required command*. This indicates the observation operator, previously
    noted :math:`H`, which transforms the input parameters :math:`\mathbf{x}` to
    results :math:`\mathbf{y}` to be compared to observations
    :math:`\mathbf{y}^o`. Its value is defined as a "*Function*" type object or
    a "*Matrix*" type one. In the case of "*Function*" type, different
    functional forms can be used, as described in the section
    :ref:`section_ref_operator_requirements`. If there is some control :math:`U`
    included in the observation, the operator has to be applied to a pair
    :math:`(X,U)`.

The general optional commands, available in the editing user interface, are
indicated in :ref:`section_ref_assimilation_keywords`. In particular, the
optional command "*AlgorithmParameters*" allows to choose the specific options,
described hereafter, of the algorithm. See
:ref:`section_ref_options_AlgorithmParameters` for the good use of this command.

The options of the algorithm are the following:

  StoreInternalVariables
    This Boolean key allows to store default internal variables, mainly the
    current state during iterative optimization process. Be careful, this can be
    a numerically costly choice in certain calculation cases. The default is
    "False".

    Example : ``{"StoreInternalVariables":True}``

  StoreSupplementaryCalculations
    This list indicates the names of the supplementary variables that can be
    available at the end of the algorithm. It involves potentially costly
    calculations or memory consumptions. The default is a void list, none of
    these variables being calculated and stored by default. The possible names
    are in the following list: ["APosterioriCovariance", "BMA", "OMA", "OMB",
    "Innovation", "SigmaBck2", "SigmaObs2", "MahalanobisConsistency"].

    Example : ``{"StoreSupplementaryCalculations":["BMA","Innovation"]}``
