Calculation algorithm "*ExtendedBlue*"
--------------------------------------

This algorithm realizes an extended BLUE (Best Linear Unbiased Estimator) type
estimation of the state of a system.

This algorithm is a partially non-linear generalization of a
:ref:`section_ref_algorithm_Blue`. It is equivalent for a linear observation
operator. One can verify the linearity of the observation operator with the
help of a :ref:`section_ref_algorithm_LinearityTest`.

In case of non-linearity, its results are close to a
:ref:`section_ref_algorithm_3DVAR`, without being entirely equivalent.

This mono-objective optimization algorithm is naturally written for a single
estimate, without any dynamic or iterative notion (there is no need in this
case for an incremental evolution operator, nor for an evolution error
covariance). In ADAO, it can also be used on a succession of observations,
placing the estimate in a recursive framework partly similar to a
:ref:`section_ref_algorithm_KalmanFilter`. A standard estimate is made at each
observation step on the state predicted by the incremental evolution model,
knowing that the state error covariance remains the background covariance
initially provided by the user. To be explicit, unlike Kalman-type filters, the
state error covariance is not updated.

  *List of names*. This list indicates the names of the supplementary
  variables, that can be available during or at the end of the algorithm, if
  they are initially required by the user. Their availability involves,
  potentially, costly calculations or memory consumptions. The default is then
  a void list, none of these variables being calculated and stored by default
  (excepted the unconditional variables). The possible names are in the
  following list (the detailed description of each named variable is given in
  the following part of this specific algorithmic documentation, in the
  sub-section "*Information and variables available at the end of the
  algorithm*"): [
