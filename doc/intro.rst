Introduction to ADAO
================================================================================

The aim of the ADAO module is **to help using data assimilation or optimization
methodology in conjunction with other modules in SALOME**. The ADAO module
provides interface to some standard algorithms of data assimilation or
optimization, and allows integration of them in a SALOME study. Calculation or
simulation modules have to provide one or more specific calling methods in order
to ba callable in the SALOME/ADAO framework, and all the SALOME modules can be
used throught YACS integration of ADAO.

Its main objective is to *facilitate the use of various standard data
assimilation or optimization methods*, while remaining easy to use and providing
a path to help the implementation. For an end user, having already gathered his
physical input information, it's a matter of "point\&click" to build an ADAO
valid case and to evaluate it.

The module covers a wide variety of practical applications in a robust way,
allowing real engineering applications but also quick experimental setup to be
performed. Its methodological and numerical scalability gives way to extend the
application domain.
