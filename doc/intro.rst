Introduction to ADAO
================================================================================

The aim of the ADAO module is to help using *data assimilation* methodology in
conjunction with other calculation modules in SALOME. The module provides
interface to some standard algorithms of data assimilation or optimization, and
allows integration of them in a SALOME study.

Its main objective is to *facilitate the use of various standard data
assimilation methods*, while remaining easy to use and providing a path to help
the implementation. The module covers a wide variety of practical applications
in a robust way, allowing quick experimental setup to be performed. And its
methodological scalability gives way to extend the application domain.
